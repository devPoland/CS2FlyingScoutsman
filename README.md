# **CS2  Flying Scoutsman**

## Plugin which tries to replicate the [flying scoutsman gamemode](https://counterstrike.fandom.com/wiki/Flying_Scoutsman).

> [!WARNING]
> The gamemode should be CASUAL, otherwise CTs wont have a defuser!

# Installation:
## 1. Install [CounterStrikeSharp v1.0.305+](https://github.com/roflmuffin/CounterStrikeSharp) on the server.
## 2. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/ProGamerXDP/CS2FlyingScoutsman/releases), then unpack the zip, and put the folder inside `server/game/csgo/addons/counterstrikesharp/plugins`
